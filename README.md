# strapi-upload-google-storage

Provider for strapi-plugin-upload

=====================

## !! UNMAINTAINED !!

I am not currently using Strapi for any projects so this plugin will remain "as-is" unless needed again. PRs may still be accepted, or you can use your own fork.

=====================

## Setup

1.  Follow the instructions at https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started to create a service account key with at least the `Storage Admin` role.
2.  Download the resulting JSON file containing your key.
3.  Copy the entire file contents into the `Service Account JSON` field under "Upload - Settings" in the Strapi admin.
4.  Enter a storage bucket to use or create.

The provider will parse the JSON for the required credentials.
